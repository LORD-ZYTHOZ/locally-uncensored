## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Setup (Windows)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat
```

That's it. The setup script automatically:
1. Installs Node.js, Git, and Ollama (if missing)
2. Installs all dependencies
3. Downloads a recommended uncensored AI model (~5.7 GB)
4. Creates a desktop shortcut
5. Starts the app in your browser

### Manual Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — the app recommends models on first launch.

### Image/Video Generation (Optional)

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   COMFYUI_PATH=C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI
   ```
3. Click **Start ComfyUI** in the Create tab, or start it manually
4. Download image models (e.g., SDXL checkpoints) into ComfyUI's `models/checkpoints` folder

### One-Click Start (Windows)

```batch
start.bat
```

Launches Ollama + ComfyUI + the app in one go.

## 🧠 Model Auto-Detection

The app automatically detects all installed models across all backends — no manual configuration needed:

- **Text models** — Auto-detected from Ollama. On first launch, the app scans your hardware and recommends the best uncensored models for your system.
- **Image models** — Auto-detected from ComfyUI's `models/checkpoints` folder. Drop any checkpoint in there and it shows up instantly.
- **Video models** — Auto-detected from ComfyUI. The app identifies your video backend (Wan 2.1/2.2 or AnimateDiff) and lists available models automatically.

Just install models in the standard locations and the app picks them up.
